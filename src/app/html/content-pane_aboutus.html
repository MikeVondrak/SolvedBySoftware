          Solved by Software, Co is a certified woman and minority owned
          business that provides custom Salesforce solutions. We work with
          clients in various industries to make their CRM fits their needs. We
          listen to their business process and tailor a solution using either
          native Salesforce functionalities or integrate with 3rd-party APIs
          when needed. We believe in configurability and extensibility to ensure
          that the solution provided can adapt and grow alongside our clients'
          businesses.

          It can be daunting to commit to a service that is billed hourly. That
          is why we pride ourselves in our detailed time tracking and provide
          our clients with reports on how their money is spent.
